            Zero two is our main heroine. She's a hybrid <br>
            species, a cross between human and saxo sapien. <br>
            She is a memeber of the APE Special Forces as a front soldier. <br>
            She's an elite parasite with animal like charachteristicks, <br>
            which keeps getting more pronounced the further the series <br>
            continues. She gets a co-pilot, Hiro, which she also gains <br>
            romantic feelings towards. However her growing animalistic <br>
            tendencies makes a tear in their development of a relationship <br>
            and the love is never reciprocated. <br>
            She is fully determined to become fully human <br>
            and in her quest to do so she drifted apart from Hiro. <br>
            They meet again a thousand years later to rekindle the <br>
            relationship, this time as kids reincarnated. <br>
